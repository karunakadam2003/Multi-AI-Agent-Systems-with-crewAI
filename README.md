# Multi AI Agent Systems with crewAI 


## Overview
This README.md file provides a summary and key takeaways from the course "Multi AI Agent Systems with crewAI" that I completed on Coursera. The course focused on exploring various concepts and techniques related to Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) using the crewAI platform.

## Course Content
The course was divided into several modules, each covering different aspects of Multi-Agent Systems:

1. **Introduction to Multi-Agent Systems**
   - Understanding the basics of MAS and its applications in real-world scenarios.
   - Exploring the challenges and opportunities in developing intelligent agent systems.

2. **Agent Communication**
   - Learning about communication protocols and strategies among agents.
   - Implementing message passing and coordination techniques.

3. **Agent Collaboration**
   - Understanding the importance of collaboration among agents in achieving common goals.
   - Implementing collaborative strategies using the crewAI platform.

4. **Agent Negotiation**
   - Exploring negotiation protocols and strategies for resolving conflicts among agents.
   - Implementing negotiation mechanisms in agent-based systems.

5. **Agent Learning**
   - Introduction to machine learning techniques for agents' decision-making and adaptation.
   - Implementing learning algorithms for autonomous agents.

6. **Case Studies**
   - Analyzing case studies and real-world applications of Multi-Agent Systems.
   - Understanding the impact of MAS on various industries and domains.

## Key Learnings
